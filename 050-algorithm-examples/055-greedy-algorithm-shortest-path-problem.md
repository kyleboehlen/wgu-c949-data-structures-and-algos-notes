# 052 Greedy Algorithm (Shortest Path Problem)

This is an example of how a greedy algorithm would approach the shortest path problem where we are starting at position A and trying to get to the End.

```
        A
       / \
      2   1
     /     \
    B       C
    |       |
    2       4
     \     /
       END
```

You'll see that the greedy algorithm will choose to go to location C first because it is the shortest path, and end up with a total of 5. The optimal path would have been to go through location B for a total of 4.
